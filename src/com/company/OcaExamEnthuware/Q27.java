/*The | and & operators, when applied to boolean operands, ensure that both the sides are evaluated. This is opposed to || and && operators, which do not evaluate the Right Hand Side operand if the result can be known by just evaluating the Left Hand Side.

Now, let us see the values of i and j at each step:

int i = 0;
int j = 1;
if( (i++ == 0) & (j++ == 2) )

First, compare i with 0 and increment i, this comparison returns true and
i becomes 1. Now Evaluate next condition:
compare j with 2 and increment j, this comparison return false and j becomes 2.
true & false returns false so i = 12 is not executed.
{
        i = 12;
        }
        System.out.println(i+" "+j)); //print 1 and 2
